Nice to meet you! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Mathematics and Physics + Energy and Power Engineering. My research interest lies in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering. I'm currently working on data-driven approaches, such as statistical methods and scientific machine learning, for fluid dynamics and combustion problems. I'm honored to be advised by [Xingjian Wang](https://www.depe.tsinghua.edu.cn/depeen/info/1297/1261.htm) from Department of Energy and Power Engineering at Tsinghua University. Feel free to contact me via social media or e-mail if you are interested in working with me or just want to make friends.
