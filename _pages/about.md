Nice to meet you! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by Prof. [Peng Chen](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~pchen402/). My research interest lies in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Engineering. I'm currently working on data-driven approaches, such as reduced-order modeling for fluid dynamics. I got my B.S. and B.Eng. from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Mathematics and Physics + Energy and Power Engineering. I was honored to be advised by Prof. [Xingjian Wang](https://www.depe.tsinghua.edu.cn/depeen/info/1297/1261.htm) from Department of Energy and Power Engineering at Tsinghua University. Feel free to contact me via social media or e-mail if you are interested in working with me or just want to make friends.
